* The best comedy is something that merges high-brow and low-brow, but isn't an awkward middle-brow compromise.
* Words are incredibly interesting.
* Miracles are all around. The world is filled with magic and majesty.

* Eating is not a solitary activity.

* I am.

## Philosophy and Morality
* The concept of "knowing something" is hard to unravel, but the key to existing is believing you know something.
