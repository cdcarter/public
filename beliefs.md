# Personal Beliefs


## Art
* Storytelling is the best form of communication.
* If you can't tell a story in under 90 minutes, you're telling more than one story, and you need to be mindful of it.
* We tell stories to create meaning.
* Art has three components that make it such; content, form, and meaning.
* Humor comes from truth in difference.
* The best comedy is something that merges high-brow and low-brow, but isn't an awkward middle-brow compromise.
* Words are incredibly interesting.
* Miracles are all around. The world is filled with magic and mystery, and that's incredible.

## How to live
* A man should have a mystery about him, how he does all that he does. (thanks @zackshapiro)
