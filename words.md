* "That’s not so terrible, even for the selfish, and commitment isn’t about increasing your burden by taking on another’s, but exchanging support and helping each other achieve joy." - You Are Not Dead
* "Skilled with detecting condescension and deceit, you must approach dilemma with a system of honest inquiry. You must strive for wellness not with the premise that you want to be better or to perform your best, but with the acknowledgment you are broken and just want to be good." - You Are Not Dead
* "You want more than a series of attachments to and detachments from this world. You want understanding—and the assurance you’ll be all right. You Will. You Always Were. You Are." - You Are Not Dead
* "Delusions are injuries you insist on having. Stop hurting. Demand healing. And if you think your delusions are risks worth taking, then confront them right now—not when you feel ready. Not when you think nobody’s looking, everybody’s looking at themselves. And if they are looking at you, they’re tired of looking at you. They are sickened by what they see." - You Are Not Dead
* "it is hard to believe when I’m with you that there can be anything as still as solemn as unpleasantly definitive as statuary when right in front of it in the warm New York 4 o’clock light we are drifting back and forth between each other like a tree breathing through its spectacles" - Frank O'Hara
* "Watch your thoughts shift; watch them make space inside your head that wasn’t there before—space to move, space to breathe, space to sit comfortably and drink tea and look out the windows. " - Madame Clairevoyant
* "spend time with people who are young in the ways that you’ve been young, people who are strange in the ways that you’ve been strange, who are wild in the ways that you’ve been wild." - Madame Clairevoyant
* "Leo: This week’s going to be about friendship, about love, about your weird wild heart working hard, getting tugged and pulled all over the world. It’s a week for letting your own feelings crackle and glow and blaze; it’s a week for seeing by their light and waking up in their gentle warmth. Let your heart go a little wild, let it shape your world and tint your vision, let it move you, let it speak through you. Let your feelings breathe but don’t let them eat you, don’t forget to listen, don’t forget to breathe." - Madame Clarievoyant

> You can love someone you're incompatible with, 
and many people do.
Most often, 
there's no reason or explanation for why you love someone: 
You just do.
People can and do love more than one person.
There is no guarantee the greatest love of your life will marry you.
Divorced people can still love each other, and yet not wish to remarry.
Not all love is constant –
many times love comes, goes, and returns like a breeze.
Most people, at one time or another, 
will confuse love with emotional dependency.
Some people can be much happier single than married.
Not everyone who loves, loves well, nor ever learns how to love well - Cafe Variations

* "And you think maybe they really and truly do sincerely want to know your life story, and so you light up a cigarette and begin to tell it to them" - Tennessee Williams

> You see, you could come to love me.
I'm crazy about you, Harold,
you know, if somebody's crazy about you,
you can't resist it finally
because it feels so good to have someone be just crazy for you
and just love everything about you and everything you do
and just be delighted in you
and laugh at your jokes and feel for you
and love to do things with you
and look out for you
and all that sort of thing
I think I'm going to become irresistible to you - Cafe Variations

* "He kept a piece of algae behind his ear to remind him of his roots. A million years ago every place was a little place by the sea, he would say & my mind would go blank & I would swim through the day without a care in the world & it all seemed so familiar that I knew I would go back someday to my own little place by the sea." - Brian Andreas

* "my hair is getting long and i miss you. the absence of squeaky train cars rattle through the cracks in my bones and i miss you. my shoes are too small for me, they suffocate my feet but i wear them anyway, and i miss you. i kissed a boy and kissed another. i think you’d like them both, and i miss you. i cannot keep my room clean, can’t keep my headphones from tangling and my music from blasting and the pen from bleeding through the page, and the stairs from leading both up and down, and the river from the ocean and the sun from the sky, and i can’t help the fact that i stay up too late every night, and i miss you. i’m clutching the tail end of summer while beckoning the fall, god i thought i was ready to fall but now i know i’m not or i think i’m not, i’m walking around everywhere to avoid everyone and i just really miss you. i haven’t written anything in a long, long time and i miss you. i jumped off a cliff. it took me two whole seconds to fall and right before i hit the water, i missed you. i see so many faces that we would both adore, and every time i see a new one, i miss you. i don’t know what to do with all the new; if i should store it in the pockets of my summer shorts or sew it to the inside of my new october coat or keep it hidden in the lace of my new lingerie that maybe someone will be seeing sometime soon. maybe i’ll unfurl the old and curl up with it into my sheets, wrap myself up in hollow surrender,  breathe it into my pillowcase and play it on my guitar strings because i miss you. your hair changed color and you finally smile with your teeth and now there are more people that will love every part of you, and while they do, just remember that i miss you. TC Mark" - [...and I miss you, Katie Swafford][missyou]
* "and i sit in the corner table of a starbucks you'll never see and sip on the drink we always shared and i miss you. you haven't seen this new haircut or the way i'm finally growing out my nails. i flip through my favorite book and there's a note from the last time you borrowed it and i miss you. i miss being the most important person, the one who could make you laugh without any hesitation and i miss the way your hands dwarfed mine. i spend a lot of time sleeping these days, scrolling through my playlists before i fall asleep and skipping over the one titled with your name because i miss you and i miss you missing me. we'll both move on soon, i'm sure, and there will be a different girl who proudly shoulders the label of best friend and i'll be here a thousand miles away kissing someone you'll never meet along the river walk on a thursday. and even though i'll move on and you'll move on, i still miss you." - addition to previous poem, author unknown
* “On the train, I sit next to a man with large headphones and a duffel coat. He has the window seat. He’s asleep. When we start moving he opens his eyes and unfolds his hands and looks down at them. Maybe he’s looking for mouths too. I think about making him this offer: let’s both tell each other exactly what to do from now until it’s over. Every time I don’t know what to do I’ll call sleeping man and he’ll tell me. Tell her to get fucked. Choose the lasagne. Wear blue. Same with him. We will never be confused again. We will be each other’s robots.” - Lolito by Ben Brooks
* [Thoughts I Done Had On Bus][bus]

* "“We waste so much energy trying to cover up who we are when beneath every attitude is the want to be loved, and beneath every anger is a wound to be healed and beneath every sadness is the fear that there will not be enough time. When we hesitate in being direct, we unknowingly slip something on, some added layer of protection that keeps us from feeling the world, and often that thin covering is the beginning of a loneliness which, if not put down, diminishes our chances of joy. It’s like wearing gloves every time we touch something, and then, forgetting we chose to put them on, we complain that nothing feels quite real. Our challenge each day is not to get dressed to face the world but to unglove ourselves so that the doorknob feels cold and the car handle feels wet and the kiss goodbye feels like the lips of another being, soft and unrepeatable.”" ― Mark Nepo, The Book of Awakening: Having the Life You Want by Being Present to the Life You Have

* "Because it was a day we contacted people we no longer loved even though we once often told them we loved them, my ex started chatting with me online." -- Allegra Lingo, ["beacuse it was a day"][day]
 
* "if you want to have loving feelings, do loving things; flirt with everyone-- old people and especially yourself" -- someone smarter than me.
