* "That’s not so terrible, even for the selfish, and commitment isn’t about increasing your burden by taking on another’s, but exchanging support and helping each other achieve joy." - You Are Not Dead
* "Skilled with detecting condescension and deceit, you must approach dilemma with a system of honest inquiry. You must strive for wellness not with the premise that you want to be better or to perform your best, but with the acknowledgment you are broken and just want to be good." - You Are Not Dead
* "You want more than a series of attachments to and detachments from this world. You want understanding—and the assurance you’ll be all right. You Will. You Always Were. You Are." - You Are Not Dead
* "Delusions are injuries you insist on having. Stop hurting. Demand healing. And if you think your delusions are risks worth taking, then confront them right now—not when you feel ready. Not when you think nobody’s looking, everybody’s looking at themselves. And if they are looking at you, they’re tired of looking at you. They are sickened by what they see." - You Are Not Dead
* "it is hard to believe when I’m with you that there can be anything as still as solemn as unpleasantly definitive as statuary when right in front of it in the warm New York 4 o’clock light we are drifting back and forth between each other like a tree breathing through its spectacles" - Frank O'Hara
* "Watch your thoughts shift; watch them make space inside your head that wasn’t there before—space to move, space to breathe, space to sit comfortably and drink tea and look out the windows. " - Madame Clairevoyant
* "spend time with people who are young in the ways that you’ve been young, people who are strange in the ways that you’ve been strange, who are wild in the ways that you’ve been wild." - Madame Clairevoyant

> You can love someone you're incompatible with, 
and many people do.
Most often, 
there's no reason or explanation for why you love someone: 
You just do.
People can and do love more than one person.
There is no guarantee the greatest love of your life will marry you.
Divorced people can still love each other, and yet not wish to remarry.
Not all love is constant –
many times love comes, goes, and returns like a breeze.
Most people, at one time or another, 
will confuse love with emotional dependency.
Some people can be much happier single than married.
Not everyone who loves, loves well, nor ever learns how to love well

* "And you think maybe they really and truly do sincerely want to know your life story, and so you light up a cigarette and begin to tell it to them" - Tennessee Williams

> You see, you could come to love me.
I'm crazy about you, Harold,
you know, if somebody's crazy about you,
you can't resist it finally
because it feels so good to have someone be just crazy for you
and just love everything about you and everything you do
and just be delighted in you
and laugh at your jokes and feel for you
and love to do things with you
and look out for you
and all that sort of thing
I think I'm going to become irresistible to you

* "He kept a piece of algae behind his ear to remind him of his roots. A million years ago every place was a little place by the sea, he would say & my mind would go blank & I would swim through the day without a care in the world & it all seemed so familiar that I knew I would go back someday to my own little place by the sea."
