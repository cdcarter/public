Hey buddy,

I googled "how to write a christmas card" but then I realized that I don't think that's what I'm going for, and also that mostly just resulted in mom-blogs.

My bio line: I'm 23, I am gainfully employed, and I've lived in Seattle for almost a year and a half now.

Seattle is a place where you learn about self-care. The stereotype of drinking more coffee than is reasonable for a human is true, but so is the stereotype of dark and damp days for much of the year. The summer is filled with life and as many excuses to be outside as possible. By the end of the summer, you're so worn out and yearning for the rain. Yearning for excuses to stay inside and listen to public radio or indie folk.

In Seattle, you take Vitamin D every day, and a probiotic, and fiber supplements. Because those are the things you learn your body needs. I eat more vegetables, I drink more too.

This summer, the festival I worked for produced *Angels in America*, a mini-epic play about the AIDS crisis, religion today, jewish-american politics, and a whole lot more. There's a line where the title Angel commands to a new prophet "The great work begins!" We used that edict to help fundraise for HIV Vaccine research.

The every day reality is that the Great Work is much more personal.

Here's a good poem for winter, when it's good to be kind to yourself:

God is an American -- Terrance Hayes

> I still love words. When we make love in the morning,
> your skin damp from a shower, the day calms.
> Shadenfreude may be the best way to name the covering
> of adulthood, the powdered sugar on a black shirt. I am

> alone now on the top floor pulled by obsession, the ink
> on my fingers. And sometimes it is a difficult name.
> Sometimes it is like the world before America, the kin-
> ship of fools and hunters, the children, the dazed dream

> of mothers with no style. A word can be the boot print
> in a square of fresh cement and the glaze of morning.
> Your response to my kiss is I have a cavity. I am in
> love with incompletion. I am clinging to your moorings.

> Yes, I have a pretty good idea what beauty is. It survives
> alright. It aches like an open book. It makes it difficult to live.

Have a lovely winter, dear
